  Preparing for a trial 
subquestion: |
  At the trial you tell the judge your defenses and claims. We are going to guide you through how to talk to the judge about these.
  But before you go to trial you may go to a 
  
  * hearing, or a
  * case management conference.
  
  Or you may go to Small Claims Court.
  
  When you go to court for these events, your plan for talking with the judge/court staff is different.

field: intro
question: |
  When you go to court 
subquestion: |
  It is hard to know:
  
  * who to talk to, - *CR: we don't actually answer this question.*
  * when to talk, and 
  * what to say.
  
  Learn more about how and when to talk to the judge so they hear the facts they need to know in your case. Click **Next**.
  
  *CR: we will be implementing code site-wide that changes all 'Continue' buttons to 'Next'*

question: |
  Your next court date
subquestion: |
  Are you going to court next for a...? 
  
  *CR: I would put checkboxes here - the buttons seem a little muddled, or maybe we could stack the buttons so they are not all on top of each other?*

field: event_case
question: |
  At your case management conference
subquestion: |
   You will probably go to a room with court staff and the lawyer who is suing you.
   They will want to talk to you about
   
     * if the case can settle, *CR - this is a little vague, presumably you and the person you is suing you can come to an agreement instead of getting a judge to decide? "The case"  doesn't settle all by itself. If you agree or disagree is part of settling, need to explain...etc*
     
     * if you agree on some issues
     
     * if you disagree
     
     * if you can come to an agreement together so the judge does not have to decide for you
     
     * what to do next
     
     * next steps in the case, like discovery and motions and *CR I think we need to talk a little more about what a case management conference is here. We are using all kinds of unfamiliar words/terms that only make this more confusing.*
     
     * a plan for trial.
     
   You probably do not need to tell the judge your defenses and claims at the conference. 
   *
   
   CR - A case management conference is not the time to argue your case, it is just way to see if you and the person who takes you to court 
    can figure out an agreement. 
    
    If you cannot agree on the issues the court helps you figure out what to do next.
    
    Perhaps if we clarify what happens at this conference, outline what the possibilities are - we don't need to say anything about talking to the judge?*
    
    [Come back here before you have a trial.  You can prepare then with this interview to talk to the judge.]

field: event_hearing
question: |
  At the hearing
subquestion: |
  You, or the person who is suing you, probably filed a motion to ask the judge to make a 
  decision about something before they decide the whole case.
  *CR - For example - ...?*
    
  If the person who is suing you filed the motion, they are asking the judge to decide some detail about the case.
  
  Read the **Motion** carefully. *CR: Not sure why this instance of motion is uppercase and bold, where earlier in question it is not.*
  
  When you talk to the judge, talk only about facts that are connected to the things in the motion.
  
  If you filed the motion tell the judge why they should order what you asked for. If the person who is suing you filed an
  **Opposition to the Motion.** Explain to the judge why the Opposition is wrong. 
  
  In this hearing, stick to talking about only things that you or the person suing you has talked about in the motion. 
  
  You can have a hearing before you go to trial. Sometimes you end up not having a trial at all. *CR - Maybe stick the first sentence at the very beginning of this question? If we say the 2nd sentence I think it needs more explanation and it seems to conflict with directions to speak only about specifics in motion.*

question: |
  Return to this guide when you are preparing for a trial. 
subquestion: |
  We have given you some guidelines for talking to the judge at your ${going_court}.
  
  *CR - if you get to this question from case management conference, we haven't given the person guidelines for talking to the judge, and in the question about case management conference it is not clear if a judge is part of the conference or not.*
  
  Come back and go through this guide again,  when you are ready to prepare your claims or defenses before a trial.
   *CR - I don't think we have defined claims - add this to autoterms*
   
   *Another thought - give peeps option to go back and learn about the other scenarios. In this question they can only exit one way or another and can only get back by using back button. Unable to explore other scenarios in interview - just in case.*

      [BOLD] Getting Ready for Court
      [FLUSHLEFT] [SINGLESPACING] At your trial the judge will listen to you and the plaintiff give facts about your case. The judge will decide if:
      
      - The Plaintiff proved their case and won.
      - If you proved your defenses.
      - If any money is owed.
      - how much money is owed.
      - If you proved your counterclaims. 

      [NOINDENT] [SINGLESPACING] To prove your case and your defenses you should show the judge proof or evidence that what you say is true.  
      
        Proof can be things like 
        - cancelled checks, 
        - old phone records, 
        - letters or 
        - testimony from a friend or family member.  
        
        If you do not have proof, but you have a claim or defense still **tell the judge.**  
        
        **Your words about what happened to you is proof.** [NBSP]
        
      % if statute_limits:
        [BOLDCENTER] Statute of Limitations 
        [FLUSHLEFT] The plaintiff can only sue you for **6 years** after your last payment or you last “acknowledged the debt.”  Acknowledging the debt means you said you owed the money:
        
        * __Bring__	__proof__ to court of your last payment.  If you wrote a letter saying you “do not acknowledge the debt” bring it.  It is hard to prove you did not do something, but if you kept notes of the times the debt collector called you or the letters you got bring them to court.
        + __Tell the Judge__ the debt is “passed the statute of limitations.”  It is "too old to collect." They cannot sue you. The plaintiff “must lose.”   
      % endif
      
      % if payment_answer:
        [BOLDCENTER] Paid Debt Already 
        [FLUSHLEFT]
        If you already paid the whole amount owed on the loan in full, you paid it off.  You do not owe the debt. 
        
        - __Bring__	proof of your payments like 
        
          - cancelled check, 
          - receipts, or 
          - bank records. 
          
          Keep organized so you can show the judge all the payments you made and that they add up to more than what is owed.  If you got a letter saying you already made the payment, bring that too.
        - __Tell the Judge__ you already paid off this debt and the plaintiff is trying to get money it is not owed. [NBSP]

      % if accord_answer:
        [BOLDCENTER] Settled the Debt 
        [BR] [FLUSHLEFT] If the plaintiff and you settled your debt, you agreed that you would pay a certain amount and owe no more money.
      
        - __Bring__	proof that you had a deal with the creditor that the debt would be settled if you paid part of it.  Also bring proof that you paid your part of the bargain.
        - __Tell the Judge__ the case should be dismiss because you reached an “accord and satisfaction”, and the Plaintiff cannot sue you for the unpaid balance. [NBSP]
      % endif
      
      % if discharged_debt:
        [BOLDCENTER] Discharged in Bankrutpcy 
        [BR] [FLUSHLEFT] |
          If you filed for bankruptcy after you took out this loan you may have discharged this debt in your bankruptcy case.  
          
          This means that you do not owe the money anymore.  
          
          If you listed the debt in your bankruptcy case, and did not say you wanted to keep paying it, it is probably discharged.
        
        - __Bring__ 
          - proof of your bankruptcy case,
          - your final “discharge notice.”  This was probably sent to you at the very end of the case, and
          - your “schedule” from the first paperwork you filed in your case.  The “schedules” list the debts you wanted to get rid of in your case.  Check if this debt is listed.  

            If you do not have the schedule, ask your bankruptcy lawyer for one or ask at the bankruptcy court.  If you cannot get the schedule, bring some bankruptcy paperwork showing the date of your case.  This will show the judge you filed for bankrutpcy after the date you took out this debt.
        - __Tell the Judge__ "This debt was discharged in Bankruptcy and I no longer owe it." 
        
        __FYI__ if the debt is not listed in your “bankruptcy schedules” but it was opened before the date you filed for bankruptcy you can reopen your bankruptcy case to include the debt.  Once you include the debt in your bankruptcy it will probably also be discharged. [NBSP]

        [BOLDCENTER] Case Was Already Decided 
        [BR] [FLUSHLEFT] If you were already sued for this debt and the court made a final decision you probably cannot be sued again.  It does not matter if you won or lost, the same case cannot be decided again.
        
        - __Bring__ paperwork from the old case.  Bring the final decision or judgment in the last case. If you do not have it, ask the civil clerk in the courthouse where the case was for a copy. 
        - __Tell the Judge__ the court is stopped or “estopped” from hearing the case because of “res judicata.”  You cannot be sued twice for the same transaction or same series of transactions. [NBSP]

        - __Bring__ proof of the old case. You need to show the judge that this is the same debt as the one you were already sued for.  If you have the old complaint that gives information about the debt, bring it.  Also bring the final paperwork for the old case.  The paperwork that says there is a “judgment” against you or you settled the case. 
        - __Tell the Judge__ it is unjust and unfair for the Plaintiff to try to get a judgement against you.  You were already sued by someone else who said they have the right to collect this debt.  
        
        Say "I am harmed by the time, money and effort needed to defend this action. I am also harmed by the fees and interest that have accrued on this debt." [NBSP]

          - proof of any promises you were told.  If you have paperwork or advertisements making promises bring them.  
          - proof that you relied on the promises.  
          - proof of what you did because of the promise.

        - __Tell the Judge__ the original creditor knowingly made false representations regarding material terms and provisions of the contract.  Tell the judge exactly what you were told <b>and</b> what you did because you were told this.  Tell the judge who told you the lie and when.  It could have been the original creditor or a debt collector.  Tell the judge, “the original creditor's fraud renders the contract unenforceable.  Therefore, the Court should dismiss the Plaintiff's claims, refuse enforcement of the contract, or take other measures it deems necessary to ensure a fair outcome.”

        - __Bring__ Proof you have that they were being unfair or sneaky.  If they gave you a really complicated contract to sign or something in really small print that you could not read bring it.  If they told you that you had a very short time to respond to something or had no choice, bring proof you have to tell the judge who said this and when.
        - __Tell the Judge__ |

But, if you are execution proof and you already made a lot of payments, like the same amount as the total amount owed if there was no interest, tell the judge.  Bring proof of all your payments.  If the plaintiff knew about your low income and still took all your payments and kept charging you high interest the Judge may be able to help get rid of some of the interest and fees. [NBSP]

      [BR] [INDENTBY 1in] Your honor, thank you for hearing my testimony and considering my evidence today.  I believe you should find the plaintiff has not proved his case and there should be no judgment against me.
